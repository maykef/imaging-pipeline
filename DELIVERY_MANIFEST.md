## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Copy Files

Place these 3 files in your working directory:
```
setup_imaging_pipeline.sh
environment_imaging.yml
requirements_imaging.txt
```

Plus all markdown documentation files.

### Step 2: Run Installer

```bash
bash setup_imaging_pipeline.sh
```

**Time**: ~30 minutes  
**Disk space**: ~8-12 GB

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
~/start-imaging-pipeline.sh
```

Should output:
```
✓ Environment: imaging_pipeline
✓ CZI I/O ready
✓ GPU available: True
✓ Cellpose GPU support: True
```

### Step 4: Use

```bash
mamba activate imaging_pipeline
python ~/imaging-workspace/scripts/test_czi_read.py
```

## 💾 Hardware Requirements

### What You Have
- **CPU**: AMD Threadripper 7970X (48 cores)
- **GPU**: RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM)
- **RAM**: 128GB DDR5
- **Storage**: 3TB NVMe

### Allocation Strategy

| Component | Cores | VRAM | RAM | Storage |
|-----------|-------|------|-----|---------|
| OS/Background | ~12 | - | 30GB | - |
| LLM Inference | Background | 60-90GB | 50GB | - |
| Imaging Pipeline | 16 | 60GB | 60GB | 100GB hot |
| **Total** | 48 | 96GB | 128GB | 3TB |

**Strategy**: Sequential use or careful coordination

---

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Separate Environments
```
Before:
  mamba activate llm-inference  (vLLM, Transformers)

After:
  mamba activate llm-inference  (unchanged)
  mamba activate imaging_pipeline  (NEW - CZI, stitching)
```

Both exist independently. No conflicts.

### Data Processing Pipeline

```
Raw CZI (50-1000 GB)
    ↓
[aicspylibczi] Read metadata, load tiles
    ↓
[SimpleITK] Register overlapping tiles
    ↓
[zarr] Write stitched volume (chunked, compressed)
    ↓
[napari] Visualize for QC
    ↓
[cellpose] GPU-accelerated segmentation
    ↓
Output (OME-Zarr, masks, CSV)
```

### Why This Matters for Your Lab

**Problem**: University labs uploading terabytes of data → network bottleneck

**Solution**: Process locally on fast workstation
- ✅ All-in-one: Raw → stitched → segmented
- ✅ Fast: GPU acceleration (96GB VRAM)
- ✅ No network: Process on-premise
- ✅ Agentic: LLM orchestrates pipeline
- ✅ Automated: Background processing with email notification
